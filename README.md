## Presentation

This is a C library to make all possible calculations on dates and time. Initially developed to develop the 'wished_wday_in_choosen_month' function, used in the [WorldClockLib](https://github.com/Vicken-Ghoubiguian/WorldClockLib) C library, it has become a separated library of mathematical calculations on dates and time. A complete and exhaustive documentation will be available very soon in this GitHub repository.
